Package: FinalSelection
Type: Package
Title: Assist the user in making a choice of food or music
Version: 0.1.0
Author: "McMillion", "Leondre", "lmcmillion@usf.edu"
Description:  Choose what food to eat or what music to listen to by selecting 
    from a list of moods and numbers. This package will ask the user to select 
    a mood from a provided list followed by a selection of a number from the 
    provided choices. The music function will narrow down a genre to listen to 
    based off of picks while food can help to narrow down a restaurant.

#So when making this package, in the long run I want to not only make it for food and music but I want to build upon it 
    much further. This is my first R package so this idea of keeping a package for functions that I may use over and over again 
    that could also turn into a bigger project intrigues me. My description file discusses how selecting
    from a provided choice will help the user make a quicker decision instead of maybe wasting time on making a
    call. For now I want to keep it simple by maybe making a couple selections maybe one from a mood and one from 
    a number but in time I want it to become a bit more complex in how the choice is made by making the questions 
    asked a bit more distinct or unique. I do want more feedback on this project choice and I also in time wanted 
    to attempt to maybe make a games package or something along those lines. Probably a package that contains functions
    such as a 'rock, paper, scissor' simulator combined with maybe like a 20 questions game that can could be constructed.
    When doing the description file I wanted more understanding on the 'depends' bolding and i've been looking up various 
    videos and blogs about R package creation so hopefully that is also cleared up more in time.
